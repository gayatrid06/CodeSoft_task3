ðŸŒŸ Exciting News: Completed Basic Calculator Task! ðŸš€

I'm thrilled to announce the successful completion of a basic calculator task using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript! ðŸŽ‰ This task allowed me to create an interactive interface with buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

The calculator features a display screen that shows user input and results, providing a seamless user experience. I utilized the CSS grid system to ensure proper alignment of the buttons, making the calculator visually appealing.

Implementing event listeners, if-else statements, operators, and loops, I was able to handle user input and perform calculations accurately. This project required some skill, but with my basic knowledge of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, I successfully accomplished the task.

I'm proud of this achievement and excited to share my completed calculator project. It showcases my ability to combine multiple technologies and deliver a functional and user-friendly solution.
